        - Status (validated, postponed, canceled, treated)
        - Auto-generated unique reference
        - Reservation date
    - This feature is fully operational and tested.

2. **Modify or Delete a Reservation**:
    - Existing reservations can be modified or deleted based on the unique reference number.
    - This feature has been tested with edge cases to ensure data integrity.

3. **View Reservation Details**:
    - Users can view detailed information about a specific reservation, including the appointment date and current status.
    - The viewing functionality has been optimized for clarity and ease of use.

4. **Sort Reservations**:

        - Total reservations per status (validated, postponed, canceled, treated).
    - This feature has been thoroughly tested, and the results are displayed in a clear format.

### Current Status:
- **Core Functionalities**: Fully implemented and functional.
- **Testing**: The system is in the final phase of testing, focusing on:
    - Edge cases
    - Performance optimization
    - UI/UX improvements
- **User Feedback**: User feedback is being gathered to fine-tune the user interface and enhance usability.

## Final Adjustments & Next Steps:

- **Bug Fixes**: Any bugs discovered during the final testing phase are being addressed.
